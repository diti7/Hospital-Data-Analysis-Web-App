## 🌱 Introduction:
This Hospital Data Analysis Web App is built using Python and Streamlit to explore and visualize hospital admission data. It includes data cleaning, advanced visualizations with Seaborn and Matplotlib, and a predictive model using Scikit-learn to forecast future admissions. The app provides valuable insights for optimizing hospital resource allocation and analyzing trends in patient demographics.

## 🎯 Objective:
- Analyze hospital admissions for resource allocation.
- Predict future hospital admissions for the years 2020-2024.
- Explore trends, peak admission periods, and patient demographics

## 🧑‍💻 Tech Stack:
- **Python** as the core programming language
- **Streamlit** for building the web app interface
- **Pandas** for data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for visualizations
- **Scikit-learn** for building the linear regression prediction model
- **NumPy** for numerical operations

## 💡 Features:
- **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Generate insights on total admissions, common conditions, and the hospital with the most admissions.
- **Advanced Visualizations:** Display trends over time, analyze peak admissions and examine patient age insights.
- **Interactive Filters:** Apply custom filters on hospital names, admission counts, and more.
- **Predictive Model:** Forecast future hospital admissions using Linear Regression.

## 📂 Datasets:
This project uses 4 CSV files containing data related to hospital admissions, COVID-19 cases, ICU admissions, patient demographics, severity levels, and conditions.
Data columns include: admission_date, hospital_name, admission_count, condition_type, patient_age_group, patient_gender, readmission_count, severity_level, length_of_stay_avg, seasonal_indicator.
